Architecture Overview:


The Calculator App is a web-based application built using React.js, styled with styled-components, and utilizes math.js for mathematical calculations. The project follows a typical React application architecture, consisting of components for different parts of the UI, styled with CSS to manage layout and appearance.

Design Decisions and Components
React Components:

App Component: The main component (App.jsx) renders the entire calculator interface. It manages states such as the display value (display), secondary mode (isSecondary), angle unit (angleUnit), and memory (memory). The component handles user interactions through event handlers (handleClick) and utilizes math.js for evaluating mathematical expressions.

Button Component: (Button.jsx) Renders individual buttons used in the calculator. Each button component receives props such as className, label, and onClick to customize appearance and functionality based on its role (number, operator, special function).

Display Component: (Screen.jsx) Displays the current value (display) of the calculator. It is styled using styled-components to maintain consistency with the overall design.

Styling:

CSS: The project utilizes CSS (App.css, index.css) and styled-components (Button.jsx, Screen.jsx) for styling. CSS is used for global styles, layout adjustments, media queries for responsiveness, and specific component styles. Styled-components are used for encapsulating styles within React components, providing scoped styling and improving maintainability.
Mathematical Operations:

math.js: The library is used for evaluating mathematical expressions (calculateResult function in App.jsx). It handles complex calculations, error handling, and formatting results to ensure accuracy and consistency across different operations.
Responsive Design:

Media queries (index.css) ensure the calculator adapts to different screen sizes. The layout adjusts for smaller screens by reducing button sizes, changing grid configurations (buttons grid in index.css), and adjusting font sizes (App.css).
Development Workflow and Tools
React: Chosen for its component-based architecture, which facilitates building reusable UI elements and managing state efficiently.

Styled-components: Used for styling to encapsulate CSS within components, enhancing modularity and readability.

math.js: Selected for its robust mathematical capabilities, including support for complex expressions, error handling, and formatting.

CSS: Used for global styles, layout adjustments, and responsive design through media queries.

Future Improvements
Enhanced Functionality: Addition of more advanced mathematical functions or scientific calculator features.

User Interface Enhancements: Further polish the UI/UX, including animations, themes, or accessibility improvements.

Performance Optimization: Consider optimizations for large-scale calculations or improved user experience on slower devices.

Conclusion
The Calculator App demonstrates effective use of React.js and associated libraries to build a functional and responsive web application. It showcases best practices in component-based architecture, state management, and UI design, offering a robust foundation for further development and improvement.
